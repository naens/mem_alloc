#+TITLE: Generalized Fibonacci Memory Allocator

This is a simple memory allocator which uses generalized Fibonacci buddies,
namely the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14... given by the formula
a_n =a_{n-1} + a_{n-4}.

Because I wanted to be sure that it doesn't work because of a bug or by
chance, I wanted to make it to work with different sizes of the pointer.

So this implementation should work with:
 * GCC Linux 64-bit
 * OpenWatcom ArcaOs 32-bit
 * OpenWatcom DOS 16-bit

Here is my kind of report after having completed this project:
[[mem_alloc.org][mem_alloc.org]].

And here is the [[github.com/naens/mem_alloc/docs][documentation]].
